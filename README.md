Resume Application Tracking
This project provides a robust Resume Application Tracking System (RATS) that leverages advanced techniques in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLM) to efficiently parse and analyze resumes. The application streamlines the hiring process by matching candidate profiles to job descriptions, enhancing candidate selection, and supporting automated, scalable resume processing.

Features
Resume Parsing: Extracts key information such as skills, experience, and education from resumes.
Job Description Matching: Matches parsed resumes against specified job descriptions to identify the best candidates.
Enhanced Candidate Selection: Uses GenAI and fine-tuning with QLORA to improve resume ranking and relevance scoring.
Scalable Deployment: Deployed on AWS for scalability and efficiency in handling large volumes of resumes.
